          <h1>Who would you love more than anything to get a compliment from?</h1>
          <p>I have a rule: ignore praise and embrace criticism. I never try to seek compliments, it’s generally a dead end. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you live so philosophically?</h1>
          <p>I don’t really know what you mean by that, but I try to pay attention always. I pay attention to everything I read, everything I hear, everything I see. Then I ignore about 99.99999% of that, and whatever’s leftover I hang onto for dear life. I think this philosophical living that you’re speaking of is just me sharing the aggregate of what I’ve absorbed over the course of my life. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>If you had a chance to travel more, where would you go and why?</h1>
          <p>I have so many opportunities to travel right now, and it pains me to, but I say no to all of it. I have two priorities right now: family, and my new company. If travel doesn’t fall into one of those two categories, I say no. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s your advice to kids struggling in school?</h1>
          <p>Just like anything else in life, this too shall pass. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the craziest way you’ve broken a camera?</h1>
          <p>Probably with a gigantic rock, smashing the camera like this (Editor’s note: picture a caveman), on the side of the Zambezi river, on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe, when I had a critical failure exactly when I needed the camera. It had to be destroyed. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>When will Karlie Kloss upload her first YouTube video?</h1>
          <p>I’ll let <a href="http://youtube.com/klossy">Karlie</a> do the talking here, and I will do a whole vlog before she launches her YouTube channel, just know that Karlie Kloss on YouTube is going to be awesome. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Why does Owen work in a donut shop? Why don’t you get him a cool job?</h1>
          <p>Okay, let me spend a little bit of time picking this one apart.</p>
          <p>So my son, Owen, has his first job right now, and he works at a Krispy Kreme donut place, at the cash register, selling people donuts. Which is a tough job. Yes, I could make a phone call and I could get him some cushy, easy, fun, cool job at a production company doing something totally awesome. But I’m his father, and I try to do what’s best for him at all times. What’s not good for a kid to have as his first job is something cushy and cool. Beyond learning the value of a dollar, beyond learning what “the suck” means of working at a place like that, he will forever, for the rest of his life, no matter how successful, or rich, or famous he might become, he will forever treat people that work behind a counter with a level of respect that they deserve, because he will appreciate and understand how hard that job is. That’s one of the reasons. </p>
          <p>The bigger reason… Two or three days ago I did a whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzEoa3_029M">vlog about life’s principles</a>, and what it means to always fixate on what do you want from life, and then figure out how to execute that. A lot of people asked, a lot of people replied with, what’s the best way to find your passion? What’s the best way to find your calling in life? I have an answer to that; I don’t know that this answer is right, but this is an answer I firmly believe in. The best way to find what you love in life is by doing something you hate. A cushy job, a cool job, a job that you like, is comfortable. That comfort breeds complacency, and that complacency breeds stagnation. So you just kind of stay there, a “fine job”, even though it may not be your dream, or your passion. Then all kinds of shit happens, she gets pregnant, you have to buy a car, you have mortgage payments, you have a house, you have this cushy life, and before you know it, you have these handcuffs, these golden handcuffs that is your day job. That you didn’t love, you never loved, it was just an easy job, but now there’s no way out of it. All that happens by doing something that’s cushy and easy. If you get a job that absolutely sucks, something you hate doing, you will spend every minute on the clock fixating and fantasizing about what you wish you were doing. </p>
          <p>Where did I find my passion for filmmaking and my drive to do what I do in life? I found it in the bottom of the nastiest, burnt up clam chowder pot ever, working at a shitty seafood restaurant, where I’d have to dig so deep into that pot to scrub the bottom that it would get all over my arms and all over my shirt. I just reeked of stale seafood; it never came off my body. But doing that for years, 50 hours a week, every week, for like 5 years, really galvanized for me what I wished I could be doing. I fantasized about having a job that I loved, doing something I was super passionate about. About working for myself and not having some asshole boss telling me what to do all the time. I obsessed over it. If I had been in some cushy, sweet, fun job that my dad got for me, none of that drive would have been there. So yeah, Owen works in a donut store, and what he will get from working in a donut shop, what he will get from a shitty job is invaluable. He might not appreciate that, you might not appreciate that, but believe me, at some point in his life, he will look back and see that that was one of the most influential jobs he could have ever had. I hope. Otherwise he’ll hate me forever for making him work in a donut store. </p>
