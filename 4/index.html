        <div class="question">
          <h1>Why don’t you put ads on your videos?</h1>
          <p>I don’t know, I guess I could. I will, I will monetize my YouTube channel, I haven’t yet because I hate watching ads. Most of the advertising on YouTube sucks. So I’d hate to subject people, that are generous enough with their time to watch my movies, with having to watch terrible adverts in front of my content that I worked so hard on. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Does Candice get annoyed with your vlogging?</h1>
          <p>Yes she does. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What do you eat for breakfast?</h1>
          <p>I don’t recommend this, but I don’t eat breakfast. I never have. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Who is your role model?</h1>
          <p>Probably Malcolm X. There’s a bunch of historical figures that I really look up to, but Malcolm X is probably at the top of that list. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How would you spend the money if you won the lottery?</h1>
          <p>Don’t take this the wrong way, but I hope I never win the lottery. I never want money that I didn’t earn. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Were you scared when you quit your job to become a full-time filmmaker?</h1>
          <p>I want to talk about risk. As a guiding principle, life shrinks and life expands in direct proportion with your willingness to assume risk. Yeah, I’ve made some really stupid decisions in my career, for my career, on a broad plane, they’ve all worked out. Every time I’ve quit my job, which I’ve done every time I’ve had a job, the people that I trust most, the people that I love, all advised against it. My dad told me not to move to New York City, because it was such a risk. Every time I took these bigger risks, the opportunity for a larger payout was always there. Life is this super-temporary, mega-fragile thing. You only get a nugget of time to really pursue the things you care about. I’m 30-… My rule is that the right time is always right now. </p>
          <p>To put a little meat on these bones, this new company that I don’t really talk about, this new company is the biggest risk I’ve ever taken. I took five years of my life to build my advertising career, I made a lot of money, I’ve been doing really great. Look at my YouTube channel, go all the way back, the last branded content you’ll see was in February of 2014. I ditched it all to pursue something I knew nothing about. This huge risk. And I did it at a time when my wife was pregnant, and there was all this vulnerability and all this scariness in my life, and even now at 33- 34, my dad said, “Casey that’s crazy, you’ve got a good thing, don’t let it go,” but I know that some day I won’t be able to do this. I know that the time is now. The right time is always now. So I had to do it. That’s how I feel about risk in general, and that’s what the struggle has always been for me: identifying risk, identifying fear, and then just smashing through it. A fear is looking back and wishing I had done these things.</p>
          <p>The most dangerous thing you can do in your career, the most dangerous thing you can do in life, is play it safe. </p>
