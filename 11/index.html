        <div class="question">
          <h1>Why do you think you’re ready to leave New York City?</h1>
          <p>I literally am going crazy because of the noise pollution in this town. There is no escape from it, and since I started shooting these vlogs and I’m shooting everything all the time, it really just drives home how pervasive this incessant noise pollution is. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the worst purchase you’ve ever made, and why?</h1>
          <p>(Lifts up hoverboard) This thing, because I will break a hip on it. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Is your app going to be free?</h1>
          <p>Of course it is. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What makes you proud of yourself?</h1>
          <p>Okay, that’s a weird way to phrase it, but how I have confidence in who I am, and the decisions I make, is that I have this moral compass in life, and it is a summation, or an amalgamation of everything that I believe in, and everything that I think is right, and fair, and just. Every decision that I make, personal, private, business, every decision I make is made through the looking glass, the perspective of my moral compass, of what I believe is right, and what I believe is wrong. If it’s wrong, I don’t make that decision; I only make decisions that I believe in. The aggregate of that, if you do that over enough time, it gives you a sense of pride, it gives you a sense of confidence in what you’ve done in life. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How has vlogging helped you as a filmmaker?</h1>
          <p>Anyone that works in any creative field knows that when there’s no impetus to create, it’s very hard to make something. Without a deadline, it’s hard to actually finish. Like that awesome platitude that I love to preach, without a goal, you can’t score. So, how vlogging has helped me as a filmmaker, is its forced me to make a new movie every day. By doing that, my skills have improved, my editing has improved, my confidence in my editing has improved; everything has been moved forward because of this vlog, because of this self-imposed daily deadline. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What is the hardest thing to learn how to do or master when you start filmmaking?</h1>
          <p>How to tell a story. It’s also the only thing that matters when you’re making a movie; can you, or can you not tell a story. If you can tell a great story, people will forgive everything; bad cinematography, bad sound, bad everything. People will forgive that if the story’s great. Adversely, if the story’s weak, if the story’s not there, it doesn’t matter how pretty it is, it doesn’t matter how much money you spent on the fanciest camera, no one gives a shit. Story is king, everything else is slave to story. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you ever critique your own work?</h1>
          <p>Honestly, after I post these things, I never watch them. I try to look forward. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you regret dropping out of high school?</h1>
          <p>That’s a tough one. Regret? No. I dropped out of high school because I had no other option. I had to get a job, I had to work, I had to make a living to support my child; there were no other options. I couldn’t move in with my parents, my parents didn’t have any money, I literally had nowhere else to turn, so I had to become an adult right then and there. So regret is not a fair classification of it, I would have loved to have continued my education, but I had no other choice. Every step, every turn, every inflection point in my life has made me who I am today, and I’m very happy, I live a very happy life. So, it’s hard for me to look back and regret any decisions. So, do I regret it? No. Would I recommend it? Absolutely not. Stay in school, don’t do drugs. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the meaning of life?</h1>
          <p>Existentialism is a very dangerous thing. Ignore it, get back to work. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you ever get camera shy?</h1>
          <p>No.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Can you speak other languages?</h1>
          <p>Ah oui, bien sur, je parle francais tres bien. Just kidding, no. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Why do you have a gay flag on your desk?</h1>
          <p>I have this pride flag as a way of saying, “hello, and welcome, to my LGBT viewers.”</p>
