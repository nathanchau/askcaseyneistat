          <p>With special guest Louis Cole aka <a href="http://youtube.com/funforlouis">FunForLouis</a>. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you learn more from success or failure?</h1>
          <p>(Louis) I think I learn more from failure. I guess all of us have this need or want to succeed in some way, but when you fail at something, especially when it’s a dramatic failure, it really just makes you stop and take account, like why did I fail? How could I have avoided this?</p>
          <p>(Casey) I think that it’s always the toughest times in your life that define who you are. Much more so than the easiest times or the best times. So failures are typically some of the hardest times in your life. So when I look back and see all sorts of pivotal moments in my life, it was always the struggle, it was always the failure that motivated me, not the loveliness of success. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s your favourite country to travel to?</h1>
          <p>(Louis) I would say South Africa. </p>
          <p>(Casey) I was going to say South Africa because that’s where I fell in love with my wife. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s your favourite thing about making movies?</h1>
          <p>What I love about making movies is it’s a way to share my perspective and share my ideas with an audience that goes beyond the person sitting next to me. That’s a really powerful thing, and that is one of the biggest motivators, that is what about moviemaking that I appreciate the most. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Louis, what do you admire about Casey?</h1>
          <p>I love his uniqueness, his creativity; there’s nothing that I can see that he’s modelled after, although he’s been inspired by many different things, it’s just constant uniqueness, I feel like every time I watch one of his videos he’s trying something different, doing a different angle, I just love that. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How tired are you of being asked what camera you shot something with?</h1>
          <p>Extremely tired! It’s the least interesting question. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the best advice you would give to somebody who’s worried about their future?</h1>
          <p>My advice is always the same, which is: keep yourself extremely busy. As long as you’re doing something, you will find your path. It’s when you become lazy that everything becomes skewed, everything becomes grey or foggy. </p>
          <p>(Louis) It’s easier to steer something that’s already moving. If you’re just static, stationary, it’s so hard to build momentum. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Casey, are you ever going to make your hair like Louis’?</h1>
          <p>I don’t know man, I don’t have the patience. </p>
