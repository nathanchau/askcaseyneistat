        <div class="question">
          <h1>Can you imagine living and working somewhere that isn’t New York sometime in the near future?</h1>
          <p>Totally. Candice and I talk a lot about moving to Los Angeles. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What was your first camera and when did you get it?</h1>
          <p>This was my first video camera, it’s broken in every which way. It was 1700 dollars, and it was so expensive that I couldn’t pay for it with one credit card, I had to use multiple credit cards, all of which I maxed out to buy this thing. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What has been your biggest failure?</h1>
          <p>I made a whole vlog called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaGKf6266PY">my biggest failure</a>. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s your opinion on bullying?</h1>
          <p>I don’t know that people can have an opinion on bullying. People are either unequivocally against bullying, or people are wrong. I loathe bullying, I can’t stand bullying. Hurt people hurt people. As in, if someone is hurt, they make it their mission to hurt other people. That’s who bullies are. When someone bullies me, by saying something malicious in the comments or wherever, I just block them from this YouTube channel. I want them out of my life, and I think that’s kind of an analogy for life in general. If someone is negative, if someone is a bully, just stay as far away from them as possible. Something that my big brother Van used to say, which is really true and really harsh, is that their life is their punishment. If someone is really negative, believe me when I say they have a horrible life ahead of them, and that horrible life is their punishment for being such a negative, hurtful person. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How would you feel if Owen got a girl pregnant?</h1>
          <p>That’s a weird question. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Are you a Taylor Swift fan?</h1>
          <p>Of course I’m a Taylor Swift fan, what kind of a monster isn’t a Taylor Swift fan. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>If you could go back in time, what advice would you give you 20 year old self?</h1>
          <p>Don’t listen to anyone. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you think it’s better to plan out your future all the way through, or just play it by ear and see what happens?</h1>
          <p>This isn’t my original idea, someone else told it to me, but it’s a great piece of advice that I’m happy to share. I believe in something called the Tarzan method. What that means is that you are Tarzan, you start on one side of the jungle. Your goals, your dreams, your aspirations, they’re on the other side of the jungle, and there’s no straight line through the jungle, it’s non-existent, it’s a unicorn. (Editors note: Watch the video for Casey’s illustration) Instead, you reach, you grab onto whatever vine you can grab onto, and you swing. The vine might carry you in a direction that doesn’t feel like the right direction, but it does bring you a little bit closer. Then you grab onto another vine, and it brings you a little bit closer still. You keep doing this until, eventually, you make it to where you want to be. But the beauty of the Tarzan method, the magic of being open minded in your pursuit, is that these unknowns, where it might take you that you didn’t imagine, that’s usually where you find something that is actually what your goals are. </p>
          <p>I don’t believe that there is a straight line between where you are and where you want to be, in life, ever. Not with family, not with romantic interests, and especially not with your career. So, an open-mindedness will yield results and outcomes that otherwise would have been unforeseeable. </p>
