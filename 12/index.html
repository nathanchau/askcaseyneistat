        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you plan on running a marathon again in the future?</h1>
          <p>Yeah, I usually run a couple a year. This year I’m signed up for New York City, maybe I’ll do one before, but, I don’t know .</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What is consistently the hardest part of your day?</h1>
          <p>Leaving work. Every day it’s a battle, because I want to make it home to see the baby before she goes to sleep, I want to see Candice, but when it’s like 6, 7, 8 o’clock, time to go home, I have nowhere near completed my work for the day. Literally it’s a struggle of mine every single day. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What was your major breakthrough in the business of film?</h1>
          <p>My major breakthrough, well, first of all, don’t kid yourself. It takes years and years and years, there’s no such thing, at least in my experience, of an overnight success. It’s just like gradual steps that get you closer to where you want to be. With that said, my first movie that got a lot of exposure was the movie called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuTcavAzopg">iPod’s dirty secret</a>, it’s a movie I made with my brother Van in 2003, and it was one of the first viral films. It was a movie that was seen 5 million times on the internet 3 years before YouTube was even out. That got me a lot of attention. That was the first step in a very long process. I can’t underscore enough, it’s never any one thing that takes you where you want to be. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the best way to find time to make films while in high school? </h1>
          <p>I don’t know, man I don’t have any sympathy for you. I’ve got a full-time job, two kids, baby, wife, house, bills, life, reality, and if I can find time to make some videos every day, then you can to. I know what high school is like, I did it for a very short amount of time, if it’s something you really want to do you will find the time. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s it like to be your own boss?</h1>
          <p>You know, the last time I had a boss, I was 21 years old, so I’ve worked for myself almost my entire adult life; I don’t know that I could function in any other environment. I don’t do well when I have someone questioning my judgment, and I don’t do well when I have to trust the judgment of someone else simply because they’re my superior. I just don’t do well in that environment. I just watched, re-watched, this amazing Steve Jobs quote from 1994:</p>
          <p>(Steve Jobs) When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.</p>
          <p>He really said it well. And when it comes to where I want to exude my efforts, and energy in life, it’s on something that I want to make sure is true to my own mission and my own goals. So working for myself is something I take very seriously. And everybody I work with are people who in some capacity, share a similar vision. So really it’s this whole “be your own boss,” but if you’re in the right place there is no boss, it becomes a collaborative effort by a group of individuals that share a mutual ambition. That’s how I like to think of everything that I’ve done since I quit my last job whatever it was, 14 years ago. </p>
