        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What is your favourite quote?</h1>
          <p>It’s in the foreword of a book called Herzog on Herzog, and the quote is something like, never have a plan B. People with a plan B will invariably fall back on it, that’s why they have it in the first place. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Where do you see yourself in 10 years time?</h1>
          <p>Honestly, I never look more than maybe a year and a half in the future. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Are you looking forward to VidCon?</h1>
          <p>VidCon. I’m going to be at VidCon this year! I have no idea what to expect, yes I’m looking forward to it?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you find being a YouTube filmmaker different from being a real filmmaker?</h1>
          <p>That’s a good question, the question is what’s the difference from being what’s known as a traditional filmmaker and being a Youtuber. And that is, when you make regular films, you are beholden to external forces to get that seen or distributed. What that means is, if I’m a traditional filmmaker, I make my indie film or my Hollywood film, and then there are studios, there are people, there are agents… there are all these avenues standing between me, and the audience. When you’re a Youtuber, you make the decision when the work is done, and then you just upload, and you share it to your audience. That’s a really big deal, and that’s why I think YouTube, and distributing on the internet, is a way bigger deal than showing a movie in a movie theatre. There’s no nepotism here. People watch your stuff online because they like it. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What will you do if your new company isn’t as successful as you want it to be?</h1>
          <p>Well you’ll be out of a job. (Sara) I’ll be out of a job, so we’ll be in this problem together. </p>
          <p>If the new company isn’t as successful as I hope, as I imagine it will be, if the new company fails, I will immediately start over and start another company. Because that’s what you do. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How has your style evolved over the years?</h1>
          <p>(Sara) Let me add to that, do you try to evolve your style over the years? Do you think it’s important?</p>
          <p>I think it’s important to get better. So there are filmmakers that literally keep doing the same thing over and over and over, but they get better every time. Wes Anderson. He does the same thing over and over and over, but each film is such an evolution of the prior film. Change is easy. Getting better is really hard. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you regret any of your tattoos?</h1>
          <p>No.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you get bored?</h1>
          <p>No. And the reason why I don’t get bored is because there’s always a list, whether it’s in my head or literally on paper, I’m sure you’re the same way, of things that need to be done. So any time there’s free time that would be occupied by boredom, you just have, there’s stuff to do, there’s work that you have to do. Do you ever get bored? (Sara) I do, but it’s my own fault; if I’m bored I have to change it up. Yeah, change it up. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How will you be marketing your new company?</h1>
          <p>This vlog, for starters, this vlog is where I’m going to talk about the new company, that was like the main reason why I started this vlog. But, mainly through other social media, and I like to think that the new company, what we’re making, is something that everybody is going to love. So we’re counting on the people that use it, people that like it, to spread it around. We’re not going to be doing TV commercials, we’re not going to be doing billboards, or banner ads, or what other annoying marketing ways are out there? There will be no paid tweets. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>When will you tell us about the new company?</h1>
          <p>Soon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you pay attention to timing when editing videos?</h1>
          <p>Timing is everything when editing videos. </p>
        </div>
