        <div class="question">
          <h1>Any dollar pizza alternatives?</h1>
          <p>Yes, and I want to be really clear on this. Dollar pizza is terrible. I do not recommend you come to New York City and try dollar pizza. There are some amazing pizza places in this town. My favourite slice in the city is called Joe’s pizza, it’s in the West Village, it’s like $2.75 for a slice of pizza, it’s amazing. Don’t do dollar pizza, that place is toxic. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s your favourite US city outside of New York City?</h1>
          <p>I love Los Angeles. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you overcome the fear of doing what you like?</h1>
          <p>I’m not entirely sure what you’re asking, but, taking chances in your career, taking chances in life is always scary. Typically if it’s something you really like, something you’re passionate about, it requires taking a chance to pursue that. What I always ask myself, the question I always push up against, is: what is the alternative? If I don’t do what I love, if I don’t pursue this thing that I want to pursue, what is the alternative? I do something that I don’t like? Because I’m supposed to? Fear is real, fear is something that you always have to confront, but what’s on the other side of fear is always something that’s worth it. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>I would love to share with you my app idea.</h1>
          <p>Okay, now I’m going to try not to sound like a total asshole when I answer this, but I feel like this relationship is about truth, and I have to tell you how I honestly feel when people, not just this person, but anyone says “I have an app idea I’d love to talk to you about.” </p>
          <p>I don’t want to hear your idea.</p>
          <p>Ideas, especially in technology and filmmaking, ideas are the easiest part. In technology in particular, you can look at an app and say, “an app should do this, that’s a great idea.” But realizing that is unbelievably hard. The seed that is the idea, it very seldom ends up manifesting into what the final version of that app looks like. What I mean by that, is when Twitter was started, it was a way to let your friends know when you were at a rave, or a concert; that’s what Twitter was, that was their intention behind Twitter. They had a little idea, that wasn’t even a great idea, but years and years of work, and hundreds, now thousands and tens of thousands of employees and millions of users turned it into something much, much, much greater. And that’s the hard part. The idea is the easy part. If you want to make something, make it and show it to me and I would love to see it, but I’m not interested in the idea. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Can you make your vlogs longer?</h1>
          <p>Uh, no. When I watch a movie that’s too short, but I really like, I’m always like, “that was great, I wish there was more.” And when I see a movie that I really love, like Trainwreck, which I saw this weekend, it was great; but it was like 20 minutes too long. So I left thinking, not that it was a great movie, I left thinking it was too long. So I’d always rather leave the viewer, I would always rather be left, as the viewer, wishing for more, than I would being left thinking that was too much. Plus I just don’t have time, like that’s crazy. It takes me half the day to make 6 minutes of interesting content, I wouldn’t know how to do 20. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you have any advice for high school?</h1>
          <p>I only went to a little bit of high school, but I do have some advice, and that’s this: when you’re in high school it feels like that is the entire world, like that is your whole universe. When you grow up and get old like me, you realize it’s not. High school is just a little blip in this huge thing that you call life. Even in this huge thing that you call education, high school is only this tiny little piece of that. So, hang in there, work really hard, and know that high school is just a moment in your life. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you still have the first thing that you built in your office?</h1>
          <p>That’s a great question, and yes, I do. The very first thing that I built in this studio was this, my overhead shooting rig. This is what I use to film all of my animations. It has a monitor, and the camera shoots straight down. The reason why this surface is so messed up is because this was the actual piece of wood that the original shooting table was made on. It’s never been changed for the last 13 years. I don’t think I’ll ever change it; it’s too awesome. </p>
