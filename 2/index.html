        <div class="question">
          <h1>Does Candice or Owen ever get tired of you filming them all the time?</h1>
          <p>Candice yes, Owen not really, he’s a total sport. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the biggest difference between raising Owen and Francine?</h1>
          <p>I was really poor when Owen was born, and when you don’t have any money, you don’t have any options. I’m no longer really poor, and now there are a lot of options, and in some weird, ironic way, it’s harder to raise children when you have options than when you don’t have options. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How many cameras do you have?</h1>
          <p>I have way way too many cameras. (Shows camera collection) (Editor’s note: Casey has a lot of cameras)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What keeps you motivated?</h1>
          <p>Well, in short, I’m here, all of my dreams and aspirations are here, and the only thing between these two is a bunch of work. So tackling that work is a way of moving this needle. That’s all the motivation I need. I love progress, in any manifestation. I’ve never struggled with motivation. Ever. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What question are you tired of being asked?</h1>
          <p>My least favourite question is: what did you shoot that on?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What camera do you use to shoot your vlogs?</h1>
          <p>I use a Canon G7X and Canon 70D. (Editor’s note: Casey has since shown a variety of other cameras and gear that he uses to shoot his vlogs. As far as I can tell, as of August 2015 he’s using a combination of a Canon 70D with a Rode Videomic and Joby Gorillapod pro as his main setup, a secondary DSLR setup with some Canon T5i or something, a Canon G7X and a GoPro)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>You’re a filmmaker. Stop vlogging. </h1>
          <p>Not actually a question, but I am more than happy to address. I premiered feature films at the Cannes film festival, I premiered a feature at the Sundance film festival, I have written, directed, edited and started my own HBO series, I have been awarded the Rockefeller grant for filmmaking, I have stood on stages and received prestigious awards, and I’m a lifetime member of the Sundance institute, and I can tell you that this, that creating a new movie every 24 hours and releasing that movie to an audience of hundreds of thousands of people, is an evolution in filmmaking. See, our job, as creators, is to further define any medium. Our job is to create the new cliches, not adhere to those that were defined by generations past. To suggest that this is anything but filmmaking, is to highlight some preconceived falsehood on what the very definition of filmmaking is. </p>
