        <div class="question">
          <h1>What happened to your Apple Watch?</h1>
          <p>I broke the metal part that connects the band to the watch itself, not Apple’s fault. I like totally messed with it and customized it and I fell off my skateboard and broke it. I ordered a new, generic part, and it just hasn’t shown up yet. Still a big fan of the Apple Watch. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Would you risk your own life to save someone in need?</h1>
          <p>Like stopping an armed robber or running into a fire to save a random child. </p>
          <p>I mean of course I’m going to say yes, but you don’t know the answer to that question until you’re in that situation. Kind of a crazy question.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What do you think about the comfort zone?</h1>
          <p>I think it’s the worst place you could ever be. When you’re hungry you want more, when you’re wildly successful you can embrace your hard work and be proud of it, when you’re in the comfort zone it’s just, blah. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you feel pressured to always record everything in your life?</h1>
          <p>No. And the truth is, I don’t record that much. I do shoots for the vlog a pretty small amount of the day; I need something to be happening in order to record it, then I put that into a story, I call that a vlog, and I post it on YouTube. It’s never recording the whole day. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Other than hard work, what advice would you give to better yourself both in life and in your career/field?</h1>
          <p>Focus. Focus is super underrated. If you commit all that you are, all of your energy, to one thing… Alright, I took this diagram from a book called Essentialism by Greg McKeown, and it goes like this:</p>
          <p>You can do 10 things to the first degree, and that’s how well you’ll do all 10 things. Or, you can do one thing to the tenth degree, and look how much better you do that. So, when it comes to focus, to put all of your energy into one thing is to do that one thing really well, to the best of your abilities, to take it all the way. To scatter yourself means you’re never actually accomplishing anything. You’re just sort of chipping away at a bunch of nothingness. And this is true for work, this is true for dating, friendship, everything. Really focusing and investing yourself into something you’re passionate about will always yield better results than scattering yourself around and spreading yourself thin. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>If you could do it all again, would you change anything?</h1>
          <p>Fun question, I’m not really into hypotheticals, I’m very rooted in reality and where I am right now, and to look back and say I would have done this differently would mean that I might not be in the position that I’m in right now, and I’m really happy with the progress I’ve made in life. So, I’m much more about looking forward and thinking what can I do now to affect my future than I am looking at my past and saying I wish I’d done this. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Can you sing?</h1>
          <p>I wish I could sing. I wish I could sing, I wish I could dance. I can do neither. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How much of yourself do you see in Owen as far as personalities, and mannerisms, and whatnot?</h1>
          <p>A lot. But I mean, I try to emulate Owen more so than, I think, he tries to emulate me. Owen is definitely a better person than I am; he’s more considerate, he’s more thoughtful, and concerned with other people’s needs. I would say that I’m much more selfish than Owen, and that’s the quality in him that I admire the most. So I try more to be like my kid than I would say my kid tries to be like me. And as a parent that’s like, I feel pretty great about that. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Does it get annoying having kids wait outside your office?</h1>
          <p>Annoying… I’ve never invited anyone to stand outside my office; the reason that I go visit them outside is because I feel guilty. I’m always flattered and always really excited about the fact that people respond to the movies I make so much that they want to come meet me. So I would never say no or be mean, or discourage. But, this is a place of business; we have 11 people working next door on Beme, there’s a lot going on here, and I’m working really hard to make this work. So the distraction is unwelcome. I try to do meetups; at our last meetup we brought 500 pizzas, we try to do cool things like that. All-in, I would say don’t come visit me here, it’s a big distraction. I will say though, that when kids come into this building, and come outside my office door, that is not cool at all. We’re trying to work in here, we’re having meetings in here, conference calls, this is a very productive, very busy company here. And having kids knock on the door because they think it’s funny or cute or clever, that they’re special, is completely unwelcome, and not cool, and pisses me off, because it lacks any respect for who I am as a professional. I would never show up at your office, I would never knock on the door of your classroom and come in there and say hi and ask for a selfie, because that’s your space. I hope that doesn’t sound too harsh; like I said, I really value, and have such appreciation, for people that respond to my work so profoundly, and I love meeting new people, but boundaries and respect is something I hold dear, and I expect that from others. </p>
