        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you get yourself out of a rut?</h1>
          <p>Work. Work is the answer to a lot of problems. It cures depression, heartbreak, all those things. When you’re in a bad place, I bury myself with work. The progress, the physical activity, the brain distraction, it breaks me out of anything. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How would one suggest that one earns money for camera gear?</h1>
          <p>Get a job. How does anyone earn money, you work. Sorry, that was mean. Get a job. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Why is Malcolm X a hero to you?</h1>
          <p>Malcolm X is my hero because the guy wen to prison as a total degenerate, as a proper criminal. He deserved to go to jail. While in jail, all he did was educate himself, and when he came out, he came out as this great, strong, maybe one of the greatest communicators of the civil rights movement. Him being the quintessential autodidact is something that’s tremendously inspiring for me, because I’m a high school dropout, I never went to college, I never went to school, and when I was younger, a gigantic insecurity of mine was my lack of education. Looking at someone who had an impact on this world as tremendous as Malcolm X and realizing the he also didn’t have an education, he just took it upon himself to educate himself, that’s moving for me, and that’s all without getting into the actual impact he had on this world and what he did, which is tremendous. But I identify with him personally because of that journey</p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Can you tell us anything about your new company?</h1>
          <p>It’s an app, we’re building an app. It’s awesome. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Divide into percentages these factors to reach success: natural talent, luck and determination. </h1>
          <p>Natural talent is highly overrated. It’s determination, determination, determination, and then luck and all that other education and stuff… it’s not even in the same pie chart. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you want your son to follow in your footsteps?</h1>
          <p>No, I just want the kid to be happy. I’m very happy and I just want him to find happiness, however that might manifest. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you have any major insecurities?</h1>
          <p>I don’t know, maybe. Maybe not. I’m too busy for insecurities, they’re just a distraction. If I do have any, I’ve ignored them for so long they’ve gone away. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Why are you always wearing sunglasses?</h1>
          <p>Because when you’re cool the sun shines on your 24 hours a day. What movie is that from?</p>
          <p>Editor's note: it's from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csHptb8APlo">My Science Project</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Are you an ass or boob kind of guy?</h1>
          <p>That’s not a very nice question, but if I had to answer, and I mean this, it’s like this. The prettiest girl in the entire world really stops being pretty if she’s not interesting. The flip of that is a super interesting girl is attractive no matter what she looks like. So, I don’t know, why do I think Candice is such an outrageous babe? Because she’s funny, fun, and holds my attention, and I love hanging out with her. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What do you think about going to college?</h1>
          <p>This is more of a universal answer about college, or life in general, but the path you take to success or happiness in life can have a gazillion different manifestations. I dropped out of high school in the tenth grade, went on welfare and got a job washing dishes because I had to. I had to support my baby, I had no other options. But that is what led me to what I’m doing today. I couldn’t have predicted that, and what I think college is really incredible for, is if you don’t know what to do, college can be a really great place to find that. That’s not just the academic aspects, but the social aspects, being around new people, living away from your parents’ house, being exposed to all of the different cultural aspects of being at a melting point that is a college. But I also think that the price of college is insanely expensive, and before you drop a couple hundred thousand dollars on school, money is fungible, how else could you spend that money, and what would take you further in life? But in general, I have nothing bad to say about education in any capacity. </p>
