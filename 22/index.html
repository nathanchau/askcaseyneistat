      <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">
          <h1>What will you do when YouTube dies?</h1>
          <p>I’ll improvise. It was like, when silent films died, there were talkies, when talkies died there was television, television turned into cable, cable turned into Netflix… The distribution medium, the genres will always shift, and creators, the people who are making the content, will always shift with it. Somewhat ironically, my HBO show was literally exactly like this vlog, and it failed miserably on television, but does really well on YouTube.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you choose the title for your vlogs?</h1>
          <p>That’s simple. I come up with the most clickbait-like title I can possibly come up with, because I just want you guys to click on it. Then if you think it’s boring, just stop watching. But I try to come up with the most enticing titles possible, even if they’re completely inaccurate. Sorry about that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What do you dislike most about internet videos?</h1>
          <p>Because you get rewarded for the more views you have online, there’s a real opportunity to sort of dupe the system by putting out exploitive content that you know people are going to click on. But I don’t think that’s unique to internet videos. If you look at television, there are TV shows like TMZ, which is both negative and exploitive by definition, but people watch that. I think it’s human nature to always turn your head and look at a car accident, but that doesn’t mean a car accident’s a good thing. Just because people want to look at it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you ever get self-conscious posting videos?</h1>
          <p>No.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s your opinion on doing YouTube for money?</h1>
          <p>Here’s the thing. Because YouTube is so accessible, I think there’s this misconception that it’s easier to succeed on YouTube than it is to succeed in mainstream media. That is not true. If anything it’s harder on YouTube; you’re competing with a billion other creators. It’s really hard to stand out, it’s really hard to carve your place, and it’s especially hard to make money. Say you float to the top, say you’re doing better than everyone else, say you’re garnering something like a hundred thousand views a day. A hundred thousand views a day will make you, let me do some math, will make you about 30,000 dollars a year. Which is roughly the same as what you would make getting a job that’s just above minimum wage. If you succeed on YouTube to the degree of a hundred thousand views a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, you’ll probably make about as much money as I did when I was washing dishes and doing prep cook work.</p>
          <p>So yes, you can make money on YouTube. It’s not easy. It is an incredibly, incredibly difficult thing to do. Out of all the creators on YouTube there’s just a couple on top that have actually been able to make enough money to make a life for themselves.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What advice would you give someone thinking about starting a daily vlog?</h1>
          <p>One piece of advice, make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons. Those reasons can pretty much be anything but: I want to be famous, I want to be rich. Maybe you want to have a documentation of your life, maybe you’re compelled to share your own ideas our perspectives, maybe you want to get better at filmmaking and doing something every day will get you to that place, those are all great reasons. Wanting to be the next YouTube superstar I think is a really bad reason.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Why did you start moviemaking?</h1>
          <p>I started making movies when I was literally living in a trailer park, I was 19 years old, 18 years old? 19 years old, something like that. I had some free time since I’d spend all of my days at home watching my baby son. When I first edited video on a crappy old iMac computer, I was just so excited that all of my ideas in my head, I could actually turn into something, and that something was a little video. And honestly, that seed of an idea, that really primitive, early motivation is the exact reason why I create movies now.</p>
