        <div class="question">
          <h1>Will you continue vlogging after your new business is up and running?</h1>
          <p>I hope so. One of the reasons why I started this vlog is because my new business is taking so much of my time that I wasn’t making any movies. So by having a vlog, it’s a way for me to talk about my business, it’s a way for me to make sure I keep making movies, and just a way of keeping me engaged with something I really love. So, I hope to maintain this as long as I can. If my business starts to suffer I will back off on the vlogs, but that’s up to me to control, so I’d like to think I can figure it out. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Besides the Empire State building what’s your favourite building?</h1>
          <p>The Chrysler building. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>On average how long does it take for you to put together your vlogs?</h1>
          <p>I don’t know, if you mean post-production and editing, anywhere between 2 and 7 hours to edit these things. I do it at home, at night, in my apartment, in my underwear. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s your least favourite thing about New York?</h1>
          <p>The noise pollution. There is no silence, anywhere in the city, any hour of any day. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Tell me how to succeed, as in motivation.</h1>
          <p>I can’t tell you that. You have to find your own motivation, you can’t rely on other people. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you surround yourself with the right people?</h1>
          <p>That’s a great question. I don’t know how to surround yourself with the right people, but what I do, is eliminate the bad people. If you’re somebody that I don’t want in my life, get out. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the bump on your daughter’s head?</h1>
          <p>Her birthmark. It’ll go away. Poor thing. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you not give a shit about what anyone thinks and just do your own thing?</h1>
          <p>That’s a two part answer to a two part question. </p>
          <p>The first part about how do you just do your own thing. In life you have two options: you can do your own thing and stand out, or you can do what you’re supposed to do, what everyone else does, and you can fit in. There’s nothing wrong with fitting in, but you’re fitting into cultural or societal norms that were created by other people. Now in some cases these norms are great, but in others they don’t make sense. These norms, these rules, were created by someone, someone just like you and me, I don’t know who created these norms, chances are they aren’t anyone smarter than you or me. So if I’m not a fan of how things are, I just do my own thing, because I trust myself, and I trust my perspective more so than that of other people. </p>
          <p>Part two, how do you not give a shit about what other people think of you. I should preface this answer by saying I definitely got made fun of a lot for the way that I looked when I was in school, and all those bullies that picked on me are all losers now. So never forget that. People who judge others, especially people who judge others based on things like looks, on whether you’re black or white, whether you’re Jewish or Muslim, whether you’re gay or straight, because of their body type, whether you’re fat or skinny, whether you have pimples or whether you have a big butt, these judgmental people, their opinions don’t matter, because they don’t matter. Judgmental people are of a lower moral authority than those who don’t judge. We, people who don’t judge, we have a responsibility to crush, to destroy those mean, judgmental bullies, and we do that with an overwhelming positivity, and we do that with our extreme open-mindedness. And when you subscribe to those values, you really stop caring what other people think, because chances are, if other people are judging you, they’re wrong. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Could you convince Candice to do your vlog one day?</h1>
          <p>I actually this morning tried to convince her to let me do a whole vlog about her, so I’m working on it. Candice is great in these vlogs, and she’s so pretty, but I understand, she gets a little shy sometimes. </p>
