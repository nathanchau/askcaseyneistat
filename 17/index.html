      <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s your favourite and least-favourite part of your average day?</h1>
          <p>Favourite part is waking up; I love starting the day. Least favourite part is the battle between, like, do I leave work early so I can spend a little extra time with my family, or do I get my work done and get to see my family less? It’s like a lose-lose. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Have you ever collaborated with Candice on any work?</h1>
          <p>No… I’d like to, I just find that work plus relationships is never a good idea, so I try to be supportive, but actually collaborating with her, I think might be dangerous. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>When did you stop smoking?</h1>
          <p>You know, I was never a huge smoker, I smoked for a couple years when I was like 20 to 23. I was running through an airport as fast as I could to catch my plane, and having trouble breathing, and that’s when I was like, smoking is for idiots, I’m done, and I quit then and there and I’ve never smoked again. Smoking is bad. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do I realize what I want to do with my life?</h1>
          <p>I literally have no idea and I’m 19. </p>
          <p>Figuring out your purpose, or your passion, or your mission in life, is really, really hard to do. I’ve always said, you should either be realizing your dreams, or figuring out what they are. Figuring out what they are is really hard. The best I could give as to how to figure it out, is to keep very, very busy. For some people that means going to college, for some people that means getting a job, for other people, it can manifest itself in a million different ways. But sitting around trying to figure it out will never yield results. (Editors note: There’s a great quote from Mark Twain; “The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.”)</p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What did you think the first time you saw Candice?</h1>
          <p>Candice was such a babe when I met her. She was so out of my league. So the first thing I thought when I saw her was: I will stop at nothing to get this girl to like me. It was a hard fought battle that one. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Favourite hobby?</h1>
          <p>Running. Running is the one thing I love to do in my free time more than anything else. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Why don’t you bike anymore?</h1>
          <p>I live very close to the office; walking is literally faster than having to lock my bike up. That’s all. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Your favourite place to travel, and where you would go that you’ve never been?</h1>
          <p>Favourite place to travel, unquestionably, Cape Town, South Africa. That’s Candice’s hometown, it’s where she was born; she’s so happy when she’s there, and it’s also this incredible place on the other side of the planet. Where would I go that I haven’t been yet? I’ve never been to China. I’d love to go to China. My ultimate goal is… I’d love to go to Space, which feels like it could happen in my lifetime. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What would you do if you woke up in the morning and realized that the last 10 years of your life was a dream?</h1>
          <p>I’d get to work!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How does Candice feel about you always being at work?</h1>
          <p>Honestly, it’s one of the reasons why I love her so much, and that our marriage is the success that it is so far, is she’s really understanding of my… Not just of the fact that I have to work a lot, but the fact that my work is who I am, and if there was any threat to that, that would be a threat to me as an entire person. Work’s not just something I do, work is literally the person, it’s who I am, it’s my identity. And she doesn’t want to jeopardize that, she’s very supportive. Candice is really great. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you love us? Us the subscribers. </h1>
          <p>Love is a strong word. I owe you guys, the people that watch my vlog, and the people that’ve downloaded Beme, and the people that follow me on Twitter, I owe so much of my career to the fact that you’ve chosen to give your time, to spend it with me and the stuff that I make. I appreciate that on a level that is indescribable. Without the audience for this vlog, and everywhere else, I wouldn’t have a career. So I appreciate that. But I don’t really know why some social media kids and vloggers say “I love you” to their audience. I love like 6 people on planet earth. 2 of them are my children. So love is a strong word, if I’m going to be really honest with you, I wouldn’t use the word love. It’s a deep appreciation for the fact that you’re so generous with your time and that you’re so honest with me and that you say nice things in the comments below, it means so much. But love? C’mon. </p>
