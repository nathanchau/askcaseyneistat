        <div class="question">
          <h1>When are you going to reveal the new company?</h1>
          <p>How about right now? Alright, very happy to announce, the name of the new company is beme. Henceforth, I will no longer to refer to the new company as the new company, I’ll only refer to it as beme. Okay, a little explanation. The reason that I haven’t been able to tell you the name of the company is because we’ve been fighting and fighting to get the URL, the web address, beme.com, which we got, but I couldn’t say the name of the company until we had it, because there’s a lot of jerks out there that might try to buy the URL out from under us, and that would cause a whole bunch of headaches for us. So, thank you for your patience, I apologize for taking so long, I hope it makes sense that I had to get the web address before I could say the name. Beme, beme’s the name of the company. I’m gonna say beme as much as humanly possible so beme sticks, because, “new company” really stuck, and I have to change that habit. Also, we were trying to get the twitter handle @bemeapp, which we got, so now, we’re good. More very, very soon about beme. Beme. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you start to be a filmmaker?</h1>
          <p>You just start. There’s no process, you just start. It takes a long time to learn, but really the only way to get there is just start. It’s like anything else; you want to learn how to play basketball, you pick up the ball. You want to be a filmmaker, you just pick up whatever camera you have, probably your phone, and just start. Overthinking the process will kill any career in the creative space. You just have to do, not think. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you budget your money?</h1>
          <p>I’m very embarrassed to say that I am terrible, absolutely terrible with money. I’m not proud of that, and I’m working hard to get more responsible, especially with Owen going to college next year. I’ve been saving for a decade for his college fund, and it’s still not going to be anywhere near enough. I want to be better with money. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How did you become so handy?</h1>
          <p>I grew up in a house with 4 kids, 2 parents; everything was always broken. So, if you wanted anything to work, you first had to fix it. Growing up in an environment like that, you’re forced to be handy. I love hanging on to the craft of making things. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What are your motivations to get up in the morning?</h1>
          <p>I don’t know, I’m always in a crazy rush to get my day started. Laying in bed is stagnation, I’m not doing anything. So there’s always a real urgency for me to get up, get out, and start the day. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s your best advice for young relationships?</h1>
          <p>Uhh.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>When the app is launched, what comes next?</h1>
          <p>I mean, what comes next is actually building out the company. Launching the app, launching beme, is just crossing the starting line, not the finish line. It’s like, if I can equate it to running because I’m a big runner, a big marathoner, it’s like building this thing has been like training for the marathon. When we launch, it’s when the starter pistol goes off, and you start. But that still means that you have the longest, hardest, most challenging run ahead of you that could last, who knows how long. </p>
