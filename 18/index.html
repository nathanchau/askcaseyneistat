        <div class="question">
          <h1>When do you think Beme will be available for Android?</h1>
          <p>I wish I could say days, it’s going to be months, we are working on it right now, believe me, I want it in the hands of Android users as soon as possible. If there was a way to do it faster, we’d be doing that. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>If you were president, what would you change?</h1>
          <p>The DMV. Why the DMV isn’t completely computerized and seamless is beyond me. That’s what I would change if I were president. The Department of Motor Vehicles. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Are you planning on making any longer movies than the vlogs in the near future?</h1>
          <p>Not really. I kind of like this whole vlog thing. I have a couple, like 3 movies, not movies, just piles of footage that I’ve been sitting on for a while, that I really want to shape into something, but I kind of lack the bandwidth right now to do that. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you find all this great music?</h1>
          <p>People send me all the music that I use, and that’s no joke. A bunch of really amazing musicians and composers. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How was LA and will we be seeing Francine and Gigi any time soon?</h1>
          <p>LA was amazing, albeit slightly overwhelming, but a really incredible experience. Frannie and Gigi will be back on the vlog, I just like, it’s sometimes hard to bring the vlog into my home. I like it, I love seeing it on there, but when I’m home, sometimes I just want to be home without the camera. So, when you don’t see Candice, or Frannie, or Gigi, know the reason why is just that, I don’t know, I guess I just want to be 100% present when I’m with the fam. Not always, sometimes I like to share. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What would you do with Donald Trump’s hair if it were to fall into your hands?</h1>
          <p>I would go like, that (feigns disgust), and then wash my hands. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How relieved were you when Beme launched?</h1>
          <p>I wasn’t relieved at all. That was like, after having my kids, the scariest day of my life was launching Beme. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Favourite part about VidCon?</h1>
          <p>When I release these movies, I really just click upload. The next day I’ll see the viewcount, but it’s just a number, it’s abstract. What was so wonderful about VidCon was literally meeting all the people that see my movies, putting a face to that, getting to shake their hands, or give them a hug, or take a picture with them. I hope VidCon invites me back in years to come. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How much do you love Ben Brown?</h1>
          <p>I love Ben Brown so much! Ben is a good friend of mine, if you guys don’t know about him, I’ll link his vlog below. Go check him out; he’s a daily vlogger, he’s an adventurer, he’s an awesome guy, he’s a dear friend. I loved hanging out with him at VidCon, that was like my second favourite part of VidCon. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you ever get burnt out from doing a vlog every day?</h1>
          <p>Yes, I get burnt out from doing a vlog every day, every day. The pivot, or inflection point, from that burnout, happens every morning, when I click upload. That sensation, that sense of accomplishment is so addictive that it drives me through the next day of burnout, and then I upload again, and this is the virtuous cycle that is daily vlogging. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you ever sleep in?</h1>
          <p>The truth is, no. I post these vlogs every morning at 8am, which precludes me from ever sleeping in. </p>
