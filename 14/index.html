      <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">
          <h1>Would you skydive?</h1>
          <p>Yeah, I’ve been skydiving quite a few times. In this video you can see me skydiving in Israel, which is a pretty amazing place to go skydiving. Also, I took Owen skydiving, also in Israel, when he was like 12 or 13 years old, which was pretty special. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How did you and Candice meet? </h1>
          <p>That’s a great question. We met… really we met for the first time at a bar mitzvah, it was out of town, she invited me to stay at her parent’s house, and I just spent the entire weekend relentlessly trying to hook up with her. She wouldn’t have it. One morning I even woke up sleeping in the dog’s bed because she had kicked me out of her bed, but we see who had the last laugh there. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Who has influenced your life the most? Someone you know personally. </h1>
          <p>That would be Owen, my son. I credit everything I’ve done to him, and I don’t think I would have been able to do really anything I would call a success in life without Owen, so, that’s an easy one. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What do you enjoy most about work?</h1>
          <p>For me, work is about being productive, it’s doing something. That sense of accomplishment, that sense of productivity is what I enjoy most about work. To me, work and life are one and the same. So all of those values hold true when thinking about life in general. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you plan on travelling soon?</h1>
          <p>I’ll be in Los Angeles on Monday.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How did you first meet Karlie Kloss?</h1>
          <p>Karlie came to an event I was doing where I was premiering a movie that I made. I don’t know who brought her, but we met then, and have been good friends ever since. Karlie is a very easy person to be friends with. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you get along with Owen’s mom?</h1>
          <p>Yeah, we’ve been very, very close his whole life. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How can I promote my YouTube videos to reach new subscribers?</h1>
          <p>You know, there’s no secret trick to growing a YouTube channel, and this is advice that no one likes hearing, but if you make great content, you will find your audience. There’s not much more to it than that. You can hack it, you can try to trick it, and you might get a little bit of followers, but if you want followers that actually care, people watching your content that actually give a shit about it, then it’s about making content that people care about. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you manage being so optimistic about everything?</h1>
          <p>What’s the alternative? To be negative, or cynical? There’s more than enough negativity in this world, and negativity doesn’t feel good, negativity is just easy. So, if you put in the time to work hard at being positive and being optimistic, it’s a much better life. But it does take more work. Negative people are typically lazy people. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How long does it take you to edit your vlogs?</h1>
          <p>Like 4 to 7 hours. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Have you ever thought about giving up?</h1>
          <p>(Shakes head at ridiculousness of question)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you ever want an extra hour of sleep?</h1>
          <p>Yes, I always want an extra hour of sleep, what kind of a sicko doesn’t want more sleep. </p>
        </div>
