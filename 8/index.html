        <div class="question">
          <h1>In a tense situation, would you run away or fight, and why?</h1>
          <p>Generally my feeling about violence is to avoid it at all costs. So always run away, except in one of three situations. The first is if you have to defend yourself. If it’s you or them, make sure it’s always them. Number two is if you have to defend someone who can’t defend themselves, like a kid, or a girl, or something. Then you fight. And three, and this one’s a little bit more controversial, to defend the honour of a woman. Meaning, if someone is humiliating, or saying things about a girl, and she can’t defend herself, I believe force is necessary to end that. But as a rule, avoid fights at all costs, avoid violence at all costs. </p>
          <p>The last time I got into a fight was probably 7 or 8 years ago. It’s kind of a funny story, Candice and I were having an argument, on Broadway, in the middle of New York City, and this somewhat imposing figure came over to us, interrupted our fight, and was trying to sell us candy, it’s like a scam that guys do in New York City. We said no, and he wouldn’t back off, and eventually he walked away, turned to Candice, and was like “fuck you bitch.” You just can’t talk to a woman like that. Then things got violent. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the least favourite movie you’ve ever made?</h1>
          <p>(Shows CD labeled Biggest Mistake Ever) That was a music video my brother Van and I directed together in 2004, it just wasn’t right; we should’ve said no. But we were dead broke and it was the first real opportunity to do something for real; it was a music video. So we did it, it came out terribly, no one was happy, and to this day it certainly has been my biggest mistake ever. From that mistake, I learned so much about when you say yes, and when you say no to gigs that involve money. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>If you had a time machine, would you go back in life and do something differently?</h1>
          <p>Yes. If I had a time machine, I would go back and be born in the year 1899. That means, I could fight in World War I, I could fight in World War II, and then I could grow up and have my adult years go through from like 1940 to 1980, the height of American engineering, when America was at its finest, and then die in the early 80s, just before the internet was born. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How have the daily vlogs impacted your channel?</h1>
          <p>Tremendously. Growth is off the charts, so many new viewers, so many new people coming to the channel, all really exciting stuff, and I still have my cannon of old movies; the first hundred movies I made were not vlogs. So the channel, the dynamic of it has really changed, but for me it’s like this library of all the work I’ve made since I stopped working with my brother in 2010. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Considering your passion for hard work, is retirement in the cards?</h1>
          <p>There are two things that I hope I never have to deal with in life. One is being sick, that’s my ultimate fear, and two is not being able to work. So retirement is like the sum of all fears for me. I hope I never have to retire, I hope I die working. </p>
          <p>My muse, my idol, my hero in life, is my grandmother. My nana, she died a couple years ago, when she was 13 years old she learned how to tap dance, and that was her passion, her dream, what inspired her more than anything else in the world was tap dancing. She didn’t stop tap dancing for the next eighty years. She literally tapped every single day. She moved out of New York City to Connecticut, she started a tap school in the 1950s, she had a tap studio in her home that she taught kids how to tap dance in, she did a recital every year where she would do a tap show for hundreds of people, and she did that literally until the day before she died. On a Friday, she had tap class where she had 20 students in her class and she was on her feet tap-tap-tapping away, and then the next day she went to the hospital, and then she died. If I could sign a contract and get that deal, that’s what I want out of life. I want to pursue my passion and work until the very end. I never want to retire. (Editor’s note: Casey also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsYAXPqVnYM">movie</a> about his grandmother) </p>

          <p>No. </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Don’t you get embarrassed walking around the streets of New York talking into a camera while your pants are ripped in half?</h1>
          <p>No. Of all the freaks and weirdos in this town I’m still not in the top 10 percent. </p>
