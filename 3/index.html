        <div class="question">
          <h1>What is freedom?</h1>
          <p>I think I stole this from Bob Dylan, maybe I stole this from Woodie Guthrie? Freedom for me is waking up in the morning, and going to sleep at night, and in between doing exactly what I want to do. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>If you weren’t a filmmaker what would you be?</h1>
          <p>If I wasn’t making movies I’d either like to be an astronaut, or a professional athlete, or- I don’t really know. All I’ve ever known is making movies. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How much longer do you think you can keep your vlog going?</h1>
          <p>I don’t know how much longer I can sustain this, but I can tell you each day I invest deeper into it, which makes it harder for me to stop. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the secret to happiness?</h1>
          <p>The secret to happiness is finding something you love, and then doing that for the rest of your life. I stole that from Rushmore. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Are you afraid of running out of stories to tell?</h1>
          <p>No.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What is your favourite book?</h1>
          <p>My favourite book is the autobiography of Malcolm X. I’ve read that book 3 times, twice in a row; you can pretty much learn everything you need to know about life in that book. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Film school or no film school? What’s the best way to make a career in the film industry?</h1>
          <p>The truth is, there are no defined paths in the film industry. Meaning, if you could go to school and be taught: here’s how to succeed in the film industry, everyone would do it because this is the greatest job ever. What it takes is defining your own path. The best piece of advice I have for someone trying to succeed in the film industry or any creative space is if you’re doing what everyone else is doing, you’re doing it wrong.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Do you Snapchat less now that you do the daily vlogs?</h1>
          <p>No.</p>

          <p>Editors note: The Q and A was cut short because of a protest in NYC. </p>
