        <div class="question">
          <h1>Are there any films you’ve made specifically for your family?</h1>
          <p>Yeah. When my dad got cancer, like 10 years ago, I made a movie for him about us kids, his kids, and I used the metaphor, an analogy, where he was a B-52 bomber and we were little atomic bombs that he dropped on the world. That was a really personal film that I made just for my dad.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>How do you think Francine will react to watching your vlogs when she’s older?</h1>
          <p>I don’t know, but all of the footage of me from when I was a baby is like around a holiday, or a birthday, or like opening a present, or some sort of event. What I would love is to see what I was like when I was a baby, or when I was a kid, just living my normal life. So if I were Francine I would love it. But who knows.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Another kid?</h1>
          <p>If having kids didn’t require the whole pregnancy thing, I would have like 50 of them. But I honestly don’t know if my marriage to Candice could survive another pregnancy. So the answer to the question about whether or not I’m going to have more kids is a big, fat question mark.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Who is the most inspirational member of your family to you?</h1>
          <p>My Nana. She died a couple years ago, but my grandmother was my hero, I made a movie about her, but she was a tap dancer, she entertained the troops during World War II; she found her passion in life, to dance, and she did it literally until the day before she died, when she was 92. She is just like, to me, she embodies everything that I’ve ever sought after in life. Which is finding what makes you happy and literally doing it every single day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Who’s Owen’s real mother?</h1>
          <p>What, like he has a fake mother? Owen’s real mother is Robin. She’s with Owen right now in Arizona looking at colleges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>Does it damage you to spend so much time working far from your family?</h1>
          <p>I think what you’re asking is: is it bad for the family that I work so much. I don’t know. It’s a trade-off in life. For me, probably because I was so poor when I had Owen, providing for my family is my number one priority. Which means that spending time with my family comes second to my ability to provide for them. What that means is that I would rather spend less time with them and know that they have a safe home and all their needs are fulfilled than it does for me to be with them all day long, for us to struggle, and me to not have the confidence to know that I’ll be able to put a roof over their head and pay for food. And I know that sounds extreme because I have a very comfortable life and I still work really hard, but it’s a concern and a fear I can’t shake, because when you know what it means to be hungry, and when you know what it means to not be able to provide for your kids, it pushes you really hard to want to make sure that they’re safe their whole lives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h1>What’s the craziest experience you’ve had with Candice around the world?</h1>
          <p>Okay. There are a whole bunch. One time, I was doing a big art show in Paris and I stayed in this absurdly expensive hotel that Sony paid for because they sponsored the event, and, the hotel was so dim that you literally couldn’t see your way around the hotel. It’s called the Hotel Costes, look it up. One night we came back, and she was really pissed off about how dark it was in the hotel, so she took a towel and she smashed out every lightbulb in the elevator, and then in the hallway of the hotel. So it was literally pitch black. She was a total troublemaker when she was younger. I don’t know if that’s the craziest, but it’s the only one I can think of.</p>
